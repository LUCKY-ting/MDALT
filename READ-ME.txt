MATLAB Code for the paper: Optimizing margin distribution for online multi-label classification

## guideline for how to use this code

1. "run_mex_MDALT_dcd.m" is a demo for the linear MDALT_dcd algorithm proposed in this paper, which relies on  "MD_ALT_train_dcd_sparse.c" to run.
You should first input "mex -largeArrayDims MD_ALT_train_dcd_sparse.c" in the command window of matlab in order to build a executable mex-file.
Then run "run_mex_MDALT_dcd.m".

2. "run_mex_MDALT_sgd.m" is a demo for the linear MDALT_sgd algorithm proposed in this paper, which relies on  "MD_ALT_train_sparse.c" to run.
You should first input "mex -largeArrayDims MD_ALT_train_sparse.c" in the command window of matlab in order to build a executable mex-file.
Then run "run_mex_MDALT_sgd.m".

3. "run_kernel_MDALT_dcd.m" is a demo for the kernelized MDALT_dcd algorithm.
Before running this program, the kernel matrix has been precalculated for accelerating the computing. 
So if you want to change the dataset, please follow the steps below to run the program:
(1) run "precalculate_kernelMatrix.m" to create the kernel matrix
(2) run "run_kernel_MDALT_dcd.m".

4. "run_kernel_MDALT_sgd.m" is a demo for the kernelized MDALT_sgd algorithm.
   Please follow the same procedure as that for "run_kernel_MDALT_dcd.m".
